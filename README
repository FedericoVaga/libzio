The main purpose of the libzio library is to make an easy API to handle
ZIO devices. The libzio library is made of the following files:
- libzattr.c
- libzio.c

libsysfs.c libsysfs.h ---------------------------------------------------------
This is a little library to handle the sysfs in a way usefull for ZIO. I think
it can be useful also for a generic program which need to handle with some
sysfs directory; but, it is _not_ my intention to create a sysfs library. I
create this tiny generic library only for my libzio which use sysfs.

Anyway, this library can read/write a sysfs attribute and build the
sysfs structure from a root directory. This is useful for ZIO because:
- ZIO use sysfs to export device registers/parameters, so user must read/write
  sysfs attribute
- ZIO organize its device on 3 sub-directory level. With the build tree
  function you can reproduce the ZIO device organization


libzattr.c --------------------------------------------------------------------
Within this file there are the function to read and write ZIO attributes.

	int zio_read_attribute(char *path, uint32_t *value);
	int zio_write_attribute(char *path, uint32_t value);
	inline int zio_read_control(char *path, struct zio_control *ctrl);
	inline int zio_write_control(char *path, struct zio_control *ctrl);

When you use these functions your program open the sysfs file, perform the I/O
on file and then it closes the sysfs file. You can use these function to
read/write from any sysfs attribute.

Two special functions are used to read/write the sysfs binary attribute
current_control. These two function can be used both to read the current_control
attribute, and the control char device from the cdev interface. If you need a
complex management of the cdev control do _not_ use these functions. For example
if you need to use select() or poll() you must handle the char device
differently because these function are really simple and they just open
read/write and close the file; while select() and poll() require opened files.

All these function accept two argument: the full path to the sysfs attribute (or
in particular cases the cdev control char device), and the element to
read/write through the attribute.
